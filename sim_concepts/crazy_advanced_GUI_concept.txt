Have a GUI (during simulation) which mirrors the text.  Clicking on a component
in the GUI selects the same in the text, and vice-versa.

But what if we go further?  What about dynamically updating the GUI during
development?  What if typing immediately resulted in the picture changing, even
if the code doesn't compile yet?  Gradual, spring-force animation would be
excellent.  And if you could visualize new connections dynamically, as you
write them?
